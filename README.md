# Goomba-lib
 This is a simple library that will allow you to work with different files related to modding New Super Mario Bros Wii (nsmbw). 

## Files accepted
* bgdat: related to levels (specifically, what tiles were inserted in Reggie)

## Why I'm doing this?
 I'm trying to learn how to work with files related to nsmbw, so I thought this could be a good idea as a start-point.

## Coming out
 Probably more files support! This is just a library, hope it's useful to anyone else.
